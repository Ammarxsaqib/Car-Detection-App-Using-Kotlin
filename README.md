Introduction
This report details the development of an application designed to detect car damage and assess its 
intensity from an image. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for damage 
detection and the VGG16 architecture for classifying the damage intensity. Additionally, Firebase 
is used for user authentication, and Python is utilized for backend model training.
Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
• To develop a machine learning model capable of detecting car damage from an image.
• To classify the detected damage into categories of intensity (minor or severe).
• To integrate these models into a user-friendly mobile application.
• To ensure secure user authentication using Firebase.
System Architecture
The system architecture comprises the following components:
1. Frontend: User interface for uploading car images, inspecting damage, and managing user profiles.
2. Backend: Handles image processing, model inference, and communication with Firebase.
3. Machine Learning Models:
o CNN model for detecting whether the car is damaged.
o VGG16 model for determining the intensity of the damage.
4. Firebase: Manages user authentication (login and signup).

Technology Stack
The technologies and tools used in this project include:
• Frontend: Kotlin
• Backend: Python (Flask)
• Machine Learning:
o TensorFlow/Keras(for model training and inference)
o OpenCV (for image processing)
• Authentication: Firebase Authentication
Model Description
Car Damage Detection
Model Architecture
The car damage detection model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify 
images into two categories: damaged or not damaged.
Training
• Dataset: A diverse dataset of car images with labeled damage annotations.
• Preprocessing: Resizing images, normalization, and data augmentation.
• Training Process: The model was trained using a supervised learning approach, optimizing for 
accuracy and minimizing loss using techniques like early stopping and dropout to prevent 
overfitting.
Damage Intensity Classification
Model Architecture
The VGG16 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, is fine-tuned to classify the intensity of 
the damage into minor or severe categories.
Training
• Dataset: Subset of the car damage dataset, annotated with intensity labels.
• Preprocessing: Similar preprocessing steps as the detection model.
• Fine-tuning: The pre-trained VGG16 model was fine-tuned with additional dense layers to adapt to 
the new classification task.
Integration and Deployment
Backend Integration
The backend, developed in Python, integrates both models for seamless inference. When a user 
uploads an image:

1. The image is preprocessed and passed to the CNN model for damage detection.
2. If damage is detected, the image is further processed by the VGG16 model to classify the damage 
intensity.
Mobile App Integration
The mobile app allows users to upload images and view results. It communicates with the backend 
via REST APIs to send images and receive predictions.
Deployment
The backend is deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) to ensure scalability and 
reliability. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are set up for smooth updates 
and maintenance.
Firebase Authentication
Firebase Authentication is implemented to manage user login and signup processes securely. It 
supports various authentication methods such as email/password, Google, and Facebook sign-in.
Features
• Signup: Users can create an account using their email or social media accounts.
• Login: Registered users can log in to the app securely.
• Authentication Tokens: Secure tokens are used to verify user sessions and manage access.
User Interface
The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Key features include:
• Login/Signup Page: Connected to Firebase for secure authentication.
• Home Page:
o Upload button: Allows users to upload car images.
o Image display: Shows the uploaded car image.
o Inspect button: Analyzes the uploaded image and displays damage intensity results.
• Camera Page:
o Camera button: Opens the device's camera for taking a new picture.
o Gallery button: Allows users to select an image from the device's gallery.
• Profile Page:
o Allows users to update their profile information, including name and profile image.
Challenges and Solutions

Conclusion
The car damage detection and intensity analysis application successfully combine machine 
learning models with a user-friendly mobile interface and secure authentication. This project 
demonstrates the effective use of CNN and VGG16 models for real-world applications, providing 
valuable insights and functionality for users.
Future Work
Future enhancements could include:
• Expanding the Dataset: Continuously adding more labeled images to improve model accuracy.

• Multi-class Classification: Extending the damage intensity classification to include more 
categories.
• User Feedback Loop: Incorporating user feedback to refine model predictions over time.
