**1. Frontend Technology**
- **Language/Framework**: Kotlin (for Android app development).  
- **Purpose**: User interface for uploading car images and displaying results.

**2. Key Features**
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload car images from their device.  
- **Result Display**: Shows damage detection results (damaged/not damaged) and intensity classification (minor/severe).  
- **User Profile**: Allows users to manage accounts and view their uploaded images/results.  

**3. Integration with Backend**
- **Communication**: Uses REST APIs to send images to the backend (Python/Flask) and receive predictions.  
- **Workflow**:  
  1. User uploads an image via the Kotlin app.  
  2. Image is sent to the backend for processing.  
  3. Backend runs the CNN (damage detection) and VGG16 (intensity classification) models.  
  4. Results are returned to the app for display.  

**4. Firebase Authentication**
- **Implementation**: Integrated into the Kotlin app for secure user management.  
- **Features**:  
  - **Signup**: Email/password or social media (Google/Facebook).  
  - **Login**: Secure authentication using Firebase tokens.  
  - **Session Management**: Tokens verify user access.  

 **5. UI/UX Design**
- **Intuitive Interface**: Focus on simplicity for image upload and results.  
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear labels for damage status (e.g., "Severe Damage Detected").  

 **6. Challenges & Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Ensuring smooth frontend-backend-Firebase integration.  
  - **Solution**: Robust API design and testing in Kotlin.  

**7. Future Enhancements (Kotlin-Specific)**
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Extend the app to support video stream processing.  
- **User Feedback**: Allow users to correct predictions to improve model accuracy.
